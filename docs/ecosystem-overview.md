## üîÑ How the Tools Work Together

The real power of fwdslsh comes from using the tools together. Here are common integration patterns:

### 1. Complete Documentation Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Legacy Docs] --> B[Inform Extract]
    B --> C[Unify Build]
    C --> D[Deploy Site]
    D --> E[Giv Release Notes]
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Extract existing documentation
inform https://old-docs.company.com --output-dir content

# 2. Create new Unify site
npm create unify-site new-docs
cd new-docs

# 3. Import extracted content
cp -r ../content/* src/pages/

# 4. Develop and customize
bun run dev  # Live development server

# 5. Deploy and document releases
bun run build
giv release-notes > RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

### 2. Content-Driven Marketing Site

```bash
# Extract inspiration from competitor sites
inform https://competitor.com/features --output-dir research

# Create marketing site with Unify
npm create unify-site marketing-site -- --template marketing

# Build and generate professional release announcements
bun run build
giv message --template marketing
```

### 3. Open Source Project Documentation

```bash
# Generate project documentation with Giv
giv summary --include-structure > PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

# Extract community best practices
inform https://docs.opensource-project.com --output-dir best-practices

# Build comprehensive docs site
npm create unify-site project-docs
